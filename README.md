# c-minus-minus-minus

very, very small subset of the C programming language...

it can do basic arithmetics on numbers + sin and cos functions. you can define integers, floats and arrays.

thats all for now :P. I made it for my compilers course project.

implementation of lexer and parser is done with PLY library... but code generation is done with the dumbest way possible (enourmous amount of formatted strings).

example of the source file and output are in 'resources' folder.
